# Introduction {#intro}

This note introduces commonly used data to follow China economy, and shows the data in graphics.

Data related to short-term trends is shown from Chapter \@ref(GDP) to Chapter \@ref(MonetaryPolicy),  long-term data is discussed from Chapter \@ref(Migration) to the end. 

Most data can be found from government department such as NBS and PoBC. There are also unique alternative datasets collected from Internet, to depict China economy from an unofficial perspective.

I update the note monthly, usually in the mid of each month. Contact me at adingminjie@163.com.
